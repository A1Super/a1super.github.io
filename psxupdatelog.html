<h3>Comet Update!</h3>
<h4>Featuring</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Comet Crashes: Comets are randomly raining down from the sky!</li>
    <li>Massive comets contain the new Comet Egg! If you happen to see one, make sure to tell your friends. You will need their help breaking them to get to the center!</li>
    <li>Mini comets may be damaged to earn rewards. It's up to you and your pets to damage them.</li>
    <li>New starry-eyed pets have been added: 2 new event pets, Comet Agony and Comet Cyclops, plus their HUGE counterparts, HUGE Comet Agony and HUGE Comet Cyclops.</li>
    <li>If you happen to see a massive comet, invite your friends! You’ll need all the help you can get to hatch the new Comet Egg. This egg is located in the center of massive comets. It may only be hatched a few times per comet, act quickly!</li>
    <li>The average of Recent Auction Prices (RAP) is now shown on pet descriptions. This can be seen by hovering over any Huge or Titanic pets. These prices update real-time to help make accurate trading decisions!</li>
    <li>Leaderboards have been updated to show player's total RAP value! This is a more accurate way to see a player’s inventory value! In addition, the top 3 leaders have statues that dance above the leaderboards.</li>
    <li>We've added over 60 new art pieces to the game! Featuring fanart from a total of 27 talented artists in our community. Thank you to all of the artists!</li>

    <li>Added 5% tax to all auction sales</li>
